# backlog

## todo

- [x] Fix links in header that result in 404s: we should either add templates for these pages or use `#` to link to the same page. (the former is preferred)
- [x] Make the header sticky so it follows along and the cart can be visible.
- [x] Check out header title "Checkout" in /checkout. The "back to cart" button is overlapping or too close to it horizontally. fix layout placing back to cart on top and checkout below.
- [ ] Shipping informatio (/shipping) page does not comply with style guidelines.
- [ ] New article should be removed.

## operations

Make the sanity team accessible by anyone. Maybe creating a user with email + password.
