# backlog

## todo

- [x] Fix links in header that result in 404s: we should either add templates for these pages or use `#` to link to the same page. (the former is preferred)
- [ ] Make the header sticky so it follows along and the cart can be visible.
- [ ] Check out header title and "back to cart" button are overlapping. fix layout.
- [ ] Shipping informatio (/shipping) page does not comply with style guidelines.
- [ ] New article should be removed.

## operations

Make the sanity team accessible by anyone. Maybe creating a user with email + password.
